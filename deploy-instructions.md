# CORS Fix Deployment Instructions

## ðŸš¨ CORS Issue Fixed!

Your backend server has been updated to properly handle CORS requests from your Netlify frontend.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added both versions of your Netlify URL** to allowed origins:
   - `https://cryptopay2.netlify.app` (without trailing slash)
   - `https://cryptopay2.netlify.app/` (with trailing slash)

2. **Improved CORS middleware** to normalize origins and handle edge cases

3. **Added explicit OPTIONS handler** for preflight requests

4. **Enhanced health check endpoint** with explicit CORS headers

### To Deploy the Fix:

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix CORS for Netlify frontend"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render will automatically redeploy** your backend server

3. **Test the connection** by visiting your frontend at `https://cryptopay2.netlify.app`

### What This Fixes:

- âœ… CORS preflight requests will now work
- âœ… Your frontend can connect to the backend API
- âœ… User authentication and data loading will work
- âœ… All API endpoints will be accessible

### Expected Result:

After deployment, you should see:
- âœ… No more CORS errors in browser console
- âœ… API health check will succeed
- âœ… User profiles will load correctly
- âœ… All frontend features will work

The server will now properly handle requests from `https://cryptopay2.netlify.app`! ðŸŽ‰
